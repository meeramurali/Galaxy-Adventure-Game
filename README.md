# Galaxy-Adventure-Game

This program uses the 'galaxy' class to simulate a galaxy of
solar systems, each of which contain a set of planets. The names of 
the suns and planets are read in from an external data file. Other information
such as planet size, distance from sun and number of moons are randomly 
generated by member functions of the 'planet' class. 
Based on these random values, a planet is determined to be habitable or not. 

Two types of planets have been implemented:
- TERRESTRIAL planets - Allow landing since they have solid surfaces, have zero or few
moons, a smaller range of size (radius), and closer to the sun
- GAS planets - Do not allow landing since they are gaseous, have a large number of
moons, larger range of size (radius), amd further away from the sun

The goal is to find a habitable planet which has an optimum distance from sun, and 
an atmosphere (based on its size)

Note: prog2.cpp contains the main() function
